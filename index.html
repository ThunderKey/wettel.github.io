            <h2>Present</h2>
            <p>I am a software engineer, currently working at <a href='http://www.postfinance.ch'>PostFinance</a> in Bern, Switzerland.</p>

            <p>In my spare time, I continue my work on <a href="codecity.html">CodeCity</a>, a visualization project I started as a Ph.D. student.</p>            

          </div>
          <div class="post">
            <h2>Past</h2>

            <p>Before this, I worked as a software engineer at <a href='http://www.cgm.com/ch'>CompuGroup Medical Schweiz</a>, where I had the privilege to work with <a href='http://www.tudorgirba.com'>Tudor Girba</a> and apply <a href='http://www.humane-assessment.com'>humane assessment</a> techniques to deal with the challenges that we face when developing large software systems.</p>

            <p>I earned my Ph.D. in September 2010 from the <a href='http://www.inf.unisi.ch'>Faculty of Informatics</a> at the University of Lugano, Switzerland. The <a href="research.html">research</a> I conducted there, guided by <a href='http://www.inf.unisi.ch/faculty/lanza'>Prof. Michele Lanza</a>, was mainly directed on software evolution, reengineering and reverse engineering, with a special focus on software visualization. I explored the potential of the city metaphor for the analysis of large evolving software systems by means of visualization and implemented a tool called <a href="codecity.html">CodeCity</a>. My work on this topic, described in a number of <a href="publications.html">publications</a>, is synthesized in my Ph.D. thesis, entitled "Software Systems as Cities", described through the following word cloud:</p>
            
            <p><img src="pics/wordcloud.png" alt="me" align="top" width="448px" /></p></p>

            <p>Before that, I earned both my Engineering Diploma (2004) and Master's Diploma (2005) from the <a href="http://www.cs.upt.ro/">Faculty of Automatics and Computer Science</a> at the &quot;Politehnica&quot; University of Timisoara, Romania. During the last years of undergraduate study, I was member of the <a href="http://loose.upt.ro">LOOSE Research Group</a>. Guided by <a href="http://www.cs.upt.ro/~radum">Prof. Radu Marinescu</a>, I worked on code clone detection and implemented a tool called <a href="dude.html">DuDe</a>. I was also a Junior Researcher at the <a href="http://www.ieat.ro">e-Austria</a> research institute in Timisoara.</p>

            <p>In between and after my graduate studies, I took several software engineering positions, cummulating over 6 years of experience in the software industry. Always in touch with the industry, I was able to apply the analytical skills developed as a researcher to the unique engineering challenges of the software systems I worked on (industrial automation, public transportation, life insurance, or health care).</p>
